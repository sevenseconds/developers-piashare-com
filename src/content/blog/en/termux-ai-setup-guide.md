## Why Install Termux from F-Droid?

> **ðŸ“‹ Important Note: Why F-Droid is Required**
> 
> **The Android Security Evolution Challenge**: Google has progressively tightened security policies since Android 10, which benefits general users but creates significant constraints for developer tools like Termux.
>
> **Play Store Limitations (Android 10+ restrictions):**
> - **Target API requirements** - Apps must target recent Android versions
> - **Scoped storage restrictions** - Limited file system access  
> - **Background execution limits** - Restricted long-running processes
> - **Network security policies** - Stricter HTTPS enforcement
>
> **Critical Issue**: The Termux version on Google Play Store is **permanently outdated** and cannot be updated due to these policy constraints. It's essentially a dead-end version that won't function properly on modern Android devices.
>
> **Why F-Droid is the Solution:**
> - **Independent app store** that doesn't enforce Google's restrictive policies
> - **Broader system access** allowed for developer tools
> - **Up-to-date Termux versions** maintained consistently  
> - **Full feature set** that developers actually need
>
> **Bottom line**: F-Droid is the only viable source for a functional, modern Termux installation on current Android devices.

## Step 1: Installing Termux from F-Droid

### Download F-Droid

1. **Open your browser** and go to [f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org)
2. **Download the F-Droid APK** (around 10MB)
3. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** in your Android settings
4. **Install F-Droid** - your gateway to developer tools

### Install Termux

1. **Open F-Droid** and search for "Termux"
2. **Install the main Termux app** (not the Play Store version!)
3. **Optionally install Termux:API** - this gives you Android integration features
4. **Grant necessary permissions** when prompted

**Pro tip:** The main Termux app is all you need for this setup. Termux:API is optional and provides additional Android integration features if you want them later.

## Step 2: Setting up Google Gemini CLI

Google's Gemini AI is incredibly powerful, but the authentication process on mobile requires a bit of finesse. Here's how to get it working smoothly.

### Install Node.js and Gemini CLI

```bash
# Update packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade

# Install Node.js
pkg install nodejs npm

# Install Google Gemini CLI globally
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

### Gemini Authentication Process

Here's where it gets interesting. **Gemini CLI authentication is actually quite straightforward** once you know the right commands:

#### Simple Authentication Method

```bash
# Start Gemini in debug mode
gemini --debug

# At the input prompt, type:
/auth

# Gemini will show you 3 authentication options:
# 1. Login with Google Account
# 2. Use Gemini API Key  
# 3. Vertex AI
```

**Option 1: Login with Google Account**
- Choose option 1 for Google Account sign-in
- Gemini will display a long authentication URL
- **Copy this URL and open it in your Android browser**
- Complete the OAuth flow and return to the terminal
- Perfect for personal use and getting started quickly

**Option 2: Use Gemini API Key**
- Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
- Add it to your `.bashrc` for persistence:
```bash
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here' >> ~/.bashrc
```
- Good for automation and scripting

**Option 3: Vertex AI**
- For Google Cloud Platform users with Vertex AI access
- Requires GCP project setup and authentication
- Best for enterprise and production environments

### Complete the Setup

```bash
# After authentication, test your setup
# You can start chatting right away in the same session
# Or exit and start a new session:
gemini

# You should see a chat interface ready to go!
```

## Step 3: Installing Claude Code

Claude Code is refreshingly straightforward compared to Gemini's authentication dance.

### Install Claude Code

```bash
# Install using npm (Node.js 18+ required)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation and check system compatibility
claude doctor
```

### Authentication Options

Claude Code offers **multiple authentication methods**:

1. **Anthropic Console** (Recommended)
   - OAuth connection with active billing account
   - Most seamless for API usage

2. **Claude App Subscription**
   - Use your Claude Pro or Max plan
   - Perfect if you already have a subscription

3. **Enterprise Platforms**
   - Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI
   - For enterprise users

### Getting Started

```bash
# Start Claude Code (will prompt for authentication on first run)
claude

# The tool will guide you through the authentication process
# Credentials are securely stored on your system
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode
claude

# One-time task
claude "explain this code"

# Continue recent conversation
claude -c

# Git operations
claude commit
```

## Essential Termux Configuration

Now that you have your AI tools ready, let's make your Termux environment more comfortable:

### Storage Setup

```bash
# Allow Termux to access your phone's storage
termux-setup-storage

# This creates ~/storage with links to your Android folders
```

### Shell Environment Setup

```bash
# Install essential development tools
pkg install git vim curl wget openssh
```

## Usage Tips & Workflows

### Quick AI Consultation

```bash
# Quick Gemini question - start interactive session
gemini
# Then type your question in the chat

# Claude Code for development questions
claude "Review this React component for best practices"
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clone a project
git clone https://github.com/yourproject/repo.git
cd repo

# Use Claude Code for code review
claude "review the code in src/ directory"

# Ask Gemini for optimization suggestions
gemini
# Then ask: "How can I improve the performance of this Node.js app?"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Termux Permissions
If you're having permission issues:
```bash
# Reset Termux storage permissions
termux-setup-storage
```

### Gemini Authentication Fails
```bash
# Clear cached credentials and try again
rm -rf ~/.config/gemini
gemini --debug
# Then type: /auth
```

### Claude Code Connection Issues
```bash
# Check your internet connection and restart Claude Code
claude
```

## What's Next?

You now have a powerful AI development environment right in your pocket! Here are some ideas to explore:

- **Mobile-first development** - Build and test apps directly on your device
- **AI-assisted coding** - Use Claude Code for code reviews and suggestions  
- **Research and learning** - Leverage Gemini for quick explanations and tutorials
- **Automation scripts** - Create Termux scripts that use AI for data processing

The combination of Termux + AI tools opens up possibilities that desktop setups often can't match - like testing mobile-specific features or developing on-the-go.

**Happy coding!** ðŸš€
