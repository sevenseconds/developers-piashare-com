# Building Responsive Components

## The Mobile-First Approach

Start with mobile designs and progressively enhance for larger screens:

```css
/* Mobile first */
.card {
  padding: 1rem;
  width: 100%;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
    width: 50%;
  }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .card {
    width: 33.333%;
  }
}
```

## Container Queries

Use container queries for component-level responsiveness:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
}
```

## Fluid Typography

Scale text smoothly across screen sizes:

```css
.heading {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 3rem);
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test on real devices** - Emulators are good but not perfect
2. **Consider touch targets** - Minimum 44px for interactive elements
3. **Optimize images** - Use responsive images and modern formats
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Start with core functionality
